# Hendrix CSCI320 Projects 7 and 10

Install `qemu` and `cargo install bootimage`, then run with `cargo run`.

## Project 10:
Use arrow keys to navigate between files.
Run a script with r.
Edit files with e.

Note that there is a bug in my filesytem code, where
editing and saving the same file twice causes a crash.
I couldn't figure this out before submitting.

## Project 7: Bare-Metal Windowing Editor

A basic "OS" that is just four windows with text editors in them.
Supports Enter, Backspace, the arrow keys, and even line-wrapping!
